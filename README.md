# Python Problems

## About
Ever wonder how people solved all these problems on LeetCode, HackerRank, or any other problem-solving site in Python? 
We're going to try to compile and share all our attempts and solutions here for juicy references and techniques!

## Goals
Ideally, we'd like document our algorithms complete with the algorithms' workings and the time-space complexity of it all.
This is for taking notes on algorithms, perfect for when that technical interview comes. But, don't let this be any
requirement; just share your solutions! The more there are, the more perspectives and help we all get. Share away!

## Submitting a solution
